# Virtual-Reality-Treasure-Hunt
#Developed by Alen Thomas
#Developed for my dissertation based on VR

#The TreasureHunt application will be of a grid split into quadrants with floating "treasure items", which for the 
purpose of this project will be represented as a cube. 

#The user looks at the cube and the cube will change colour.(Change colour to gold)

#While gold, the user can activate the Cardboard trigger. (using the touch trigger on their Cardboard Headset)

#Once the trigger is activated, the treasue item will randomly reposition itself to some part of the VR Space.
